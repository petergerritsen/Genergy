A energy usage monitoring solution for use with a Dutch Smart Meter P1 port.

Components used are:
+ Netduino project for reading data from the P1 port and s0 pulse of a KwH meter.
+ Web application to store and display the usage information.


Project name is a combination of my last name "Gerritsen" and the words "Energy" and "Generation"
